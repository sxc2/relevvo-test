    "Quicksort is a type of divide and conquer algorithm for sorting an array, based on a partitioning routine; the details of this partitioning can vary somewhat, so that quicksort is really a family of closely related algorithms. Applied to a range of at least two elements, partitioning produces a division into two consecutive non empty sub-ranges, in such a way that no element of the first sub-range is greater than any element of the second sub-range. After applying this partition, quicksort then recursively sorts the sub-ranges, possibly after excluding from them an element at the point of division that is at this point known to be already in its final location. Due to its recursive nature, quicksort (like the partition routine) has to be formulated so as to be callable for a range within a larger array, even if the ultimate goal is to sort a complete array. The steps for in-place quicksort are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If the range has less than two elements, return immediately as there is nothing to do. Possibly for other very short lengths a special-purpose sorting method is applied and the remainder of these steps skipped.\n",
    "2. Otherwise pick a value, called a pivot, that occurs in the range (the precise manner of choosing depends on the partition routine, and can involve randomness).\n",
    "3. Partition the range: reorder its elements, while determining a point of division, so that all elements with values less than the pivot come before the division, while all elements with values greater than the pivot come after it; elements that are equal to the pivot can go either way. Since at least one instance of the pivot is present, most partition routines ensure that the value that ends up at the point of division is equal to the pivot, and is now in its final position (but termination of quicksort does not depend on this, as long as sub-ranges strictly smaller than the original are produced).\n",
    "4. Recursively apply the quicksort to the sub-range up to the point of division and to the sub-range after it, possibly excluding from both ranges the element equal to the pivot at the point of division. (If the partition produces a possibly larger sub-range near the boundary where all elements are known to be equal to the pivot, these can be excluded as well.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **choice of partition routine (including the pivot selection) can affect the algorithm's performance, possibly to a great extent for specific input arrays.** In discussing the efficiency of quicksort, it is therefore necessary to specify these choices first."
